## Summary
With over 5 years of practical ASIC design expertise, I excel in capturing design specifications, converting them into architecture and micro-architecture, implementing the system in System-Verilog HDL, and executing physical design using industry-standard EDA tools. Notably, I have played a pivotal role in two successful TSMC 65nm tape-outs of RISC-V processors. Currently, I am actively engaged in the microarchitecture and physical design of a Match-Action processor at DreamBig Semiconductor.

## Projects

### RISC-V Processor Design: NTiny [[link1](https://www.dawn.com/news/1694672), [link2](https://ics.seecs.edu.pk/research#h.bbd8fxi223bq)]

*Aug 2021 – Feb 2023*

- Played an integral role in the ground-up development and successful tape-out of a 1mmX1mm RISC-V based micro-
controller chip, [Nust-Tiny (NTiny)](https://ics.seecs.edu.pk/research#h.bbd8fxi223bq), on the TSMC 65nm node, with 50MHz operating frequency.
- Lead the design, implementation, and verification of its un-core system and peripheral IPs (UART, I2C, SPI).
- Worked on single precision floating-point unit (FPU) for in-house processor core.
- Emulation of NTiny softcore on Intel FPGA.
- Used chipalliance RISC-V DV framework and Cadence Incisive tool for verification and coverage of processor core.
- Developed eclipse based SDK for software development on NTiny(soft-core & ASIC) enabled both programming and debugging feature in Eclipse for NTiny
